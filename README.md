Privacy Policy — Memory Blast

Last updated: 2025-12-26

This Privacy Policy describes how Memory Blast (“the App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.

1. Information We Collect

The App itself does not require you to create an account and does not ask you to provide personal information directly.

However, the App may use third-party services that automatically collect certain information for advertising and analytics purposes, such as:

device identifiers (including Advertising ID, where available),

IP address (may be used to estimate approximate location),

device information (model, OS version, language),

app usage information (e.g., ad interactions, session data),

diagnostic data (crash reports, performance).

2. Advertising

The App displays ads using third-party advertising services (for example, Unity Ads). These services may use the Advertising ID and similar technologies to show ads, measure performance, and prevent fraud.

You can reset or limit ad personalization in your device settings:

Android: Settings → Google → Ads (or Privacy) → Ad controls / Reset Advertising ID.

3. How We Use Information

Collected information may be used to:

show and personalize ads (if enabled on the device),

measure ad performance and app usage,

improve stability and fix bugs,

prevent fraud and abuse.

4. Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal information. Information may be shared with third-party service providers only to operate and improve the App (e.g., advertising, analytics, crash reporting).

5. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

6. Data Retention

Third-party services may retain collected data for as long as necessary to provide their services, comply with legal obligations, and enforce their policies.

7. Your Choices

You can:

limit ad personalization via your device privacy settings,

uninstall the App to stop data collection from the App.
